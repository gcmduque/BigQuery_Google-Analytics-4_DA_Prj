# Data Cleaning and Analysis of E-Commerce Data

### Project Overview
A DA project that uses BigQuery to clean and analyze e-commerce data from Bigquery-public-data. This project aims to demonstrate the data analysis process by completing the following tasks:

- Task 1. Prepare data for building reports in BI systems
- Task 2. Calculating conversions by date and traffic channel
- Task 3. Comparing conversion rates between different landing pages
- Task 4. Checking the correlation between user engagement and purchases

### Data Sources
The primary data source for this project is from "bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce", a public dataset collected with Google Analytics 4 in the Google Web Store.

### Tools
For this project, I used DBeaver for both data cleaning and analysis. I was able to do this by establishing a connection from BigQuery via service accounts and used its credentials to establish a connection in DBeaver.
